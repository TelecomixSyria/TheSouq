## Advices
- Try to respect the current folder hierarchy.
- No big media files.
- As much as possible, use git-friendly formats.

## Directories
This repository contains the following directories:

- _artwork/_ shall contain graphic fun, preferably in git-friendly format (SVG is ideal!)
- _code/_ shall contain pieces of code which do not consist of a separate repository because it is not worth it
- _documents/_ shall contain structured pieces of documentation on various topic, which again are not worth having a separate repo
- _resources/_ shall contain other useful technical resources which are not code or structured documentation 
- _syria/_ says it all.
