    <h1>Short story of a Demonstration at Aleppo Uni. on Feb. 22th, 2012</h1>
    <h2>From Telecomix agent Muhammad in Aleppo (reachable on <a href="https://new.punkbob.com/chat/">IRC</a>) who participated</h2>
    <p>
      It took place on 22-2-2012, it was a huge demonstration in the university of Aleppo. We marched the university and we were more than 7000 of demonstrators.<br />
      We arrived to the Square of Medicine College (where you see the flags), then raised the flag of independence instead of the current flag.<br />
      We attacked a marble picture of Hafez Assad in that square.<br  />
      Then we got out of the university to the University Square and there we were about 1500 of demonstrators, then the security forces started to shoot us using live bullets, I have had a news that one student was injured, some arrested.<br />
      As a result of this great demonstration, the University File was transferred from Military Security to Air-force Intelligence (AlMukhabarat AlJawwieh), AlMukhabarat AlJawwieh is the most criminal, dangerous and the dirtiest intelligence branch in Syria. <br />
