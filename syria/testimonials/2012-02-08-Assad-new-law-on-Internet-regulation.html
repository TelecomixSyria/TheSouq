    Syria - Internet Censorship Law, issued by Bashar al-Assad on Feb. 8th 2012</h1>
<p>
    Bashar al-Assad has issued legislative decree No. 17 for the year 2012 on applying rules of the internet communication law and combating cybercrime.<br />
    The executive instructions and explanatory notes related to the law are to be issued by the Ministry of Communication and Technology.<br />
    The legislative decree is published in SANA (&nbsp;<a href="http://sana.sy/ara/2/2012/02/09/399498.htm">http://sana.sy/ara/2/2012/02/09/399498.htm</a>&nbsp;) in the 9th of February 2012.</p>
<p>
    Those people will allow you (or not) to have a website, provide internet... : National Commission for Network Services in the ministry of communication and technology according to the digital signature and network services No.4 in 2009.</p>
<p>
    <br />
    Well.. We all heard him Praises and boasts about the Syrian-ES (Syrian Electronic Soldiers) and we saw some of their defacement (which is, ironically by definition: changing website&#39;s contents!) to many sites, starting with opposition websites, all the way up to American universities sites.</p>
<p>
    <br />
    The most surprising thing we discovered, that this &quot;Syrian-es&quot; has a resources bigger and stronger than any Syrian citizen; which led us -eventually- that it&#39;s an online security branch of the famous Syrian intelligence. I&#39;m a little confused here.. Assad is encouraging all kinds of crimes (from cyber-crime, up to suicidal bombing) when it&#39;s to his benefits&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; and prohibit it on anyone else!</p>
