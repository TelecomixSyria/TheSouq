    <h2>From Telecomix agent Muhammad in Aleppo (reachable on IRC) who was fleeing a demonstration that got trapped by regime forces</h2>
    <p>
      8:10 pm<br />
      I get out of the bus. The demonstration will take place after about 300 meters. My friend and I are walking and scanning the area, we passed half of the way and we didn't see anything suspicious. After that, I started to notice Shabbiha in the area in addtion of security forces, everything went terribly.<br/>
      We walked into a bystreet, we were like a birds in a trap, I've seen them in my eyes.<br/>
      It was canceled, that is obvious, the problem is: Can we stop the others from erupting the demonstratin? We went into a mini-shop, bought two pieces of cake (to camouflage).<br/>
      While we were walking, two Shabbiha were face-to-face with us, and they left us. They wanted to catch the biggest number they can. A Mercides police car stoped near me.<br/>
      We entered another shop, it takes place in opposite the place of demonstrating, I thought it was imposible that someone will cheer to start it, well, I was wrong.<br/>
      Three seconds after we entered the shop, it was started.<br/>
      At first, no one joined him, the trap was obvious for those who scanned the area. However, those who came from the western area didn't notice it. Few joined, then the number was about 30.<br/>
      I get out of the shop to see, and to try to warn, but it was too late. When I saw them I couldn't stay at my place, I crossed the street and standed between them.<br/>
      Few seconds after, we have heard an electric stick sound. Then they attacked us.<br/>
      The piece of cake was still in my hand, crossed the street again. The shop's door was closed.<br/>
      Suddenly, a security agent standed in front of me and pointed his Klachikov to me while they were arresting other people. He looked at me carefully, I raised my hands up (the cake still with me).<br/>
      He was nervous,that's obvious. I was afraid. However I was calm, so calm.<br/>
      He saw legs moving, so he asked me angrily and nervously to open the shop. It was a kid's legs.<br/>
      Four kids, an old-man and my friend were into the shop.<br/>
      Was he schocked? I don't know.<br/>
      Then he looked at me, and told me to enter the shop and to close it.<br/>
      My hands were benumbed, and guess what? While we were hearing gun-fire, the old-man (seller) asked us to leave! In the god sake!<br/>
      We started to buy some stuff so he shut-up.<br/>
      Then, a man opened the shop and the gunfire was stopped. We left the shop, took a Taxi and left the area. <br/>
