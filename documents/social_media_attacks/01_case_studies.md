## Case studies
This chapter gives examples of case studies that happened in the past, in order to illustrate some of the various ways that social media can be exploited to collect personal information on people, to suppress information, to influence opinions, etc.

### The arrest of Saddam Hussein
The former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein showed up after the fall of his reign in the Al-Adhamiya district in Baghdad at 9th of April 2003, it was his last show on the media, accompanied by a beefy man which he was the main bodyguard for Saddam at the time. The guards where protecting Saddam Hussein from the supporters around him, and then the beefy man went with him into the car; Saddam Hussein disappeared after that day.

> "In the immediate aftermath of Saddam Hussein's capture on Dec. 13, 2003, network theory got a brief moment of glory. The Washington Post ran a [story](http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/499330771.html) about the role of "link diagrams" in Hussein's capture, and a handful of other articles made reference to the chart that Jim Hickey and Brian Reed had constructed." ([1](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/searching_for_saddam/2010/02/searching_for_saddam.html))

The U.S intelligence services considered The Colonel Mohammed Ibrahim Al-Musslit - or "The Fat Man" as they called it - will be the primary gate to access Saddam Hussein's place, and on that basis, U.S Intelligence has to bring experts in the analysis of social networks in order to find Saddam.

The story began when the social networking experts draw the family and friends tree for Saddam's bodyguard (Fat Man) and trying to find and do the same for the closer people in the network. 
Indeed, arrests began, according to the network's levels closest to the Fat man, starting from the sons of his brother through to his younger brother. 
The Wanted list at that time included 20 names of people who U.S Intelligence studied their movements too, and discovered that most of them were providing support for Saddam Hussein. 
This support ranged between daily needs coordination and coordination of movement for the relocation.
All the previous analyzes, had been done in less than 24 hours after the first arrest in the network, brought intelligence by tracking phone call for the "Fat Man", which in turn, under Pressure, he directed U.S the hiding place of Saddam Hussein which it was farm, then they found him hiding underground.

### Investigation on staff in charge of surveillance and censorship in Syria
Around the affair of the [Fortinet devices present in Syria](http://bluecabinet.info/wiki/Blue_cabinet/Fortinet/Syria) under the control of the Syrian government, investigations allowed to pinpoint a few names of people responsible or potentially responsible of being charge of those devices.

The peculiarity of this investigation is that, unlike the capture of Saddam Hussein, it did not involve any official authorities with special capabilities or allowances. Information was obtained for its greatest part by searching into publicly available data and combining it with informal discussions (on publicly reachable IRC networks and channels) and privately obtained information.

It led to the very precise identification of a [small number of people](http://bluecabinet.info/wiki/Blue_cabinet/Fortinet/Syria#People_involved_in_massive_surveillance) closely involved with the regime's surveillance and censorship systems, to some of their relationships and to a large part of their past which enabled to understand more deeply their relations with the central power.

Publicly available exploited information included:

- Facebook pages to retrieve information on people's past, political orientation, job, etc.;
- published PGP signatures as an evidence of closeness between two key people;
- websites of institutions such as schools, companies and events like conferences to further identify the persons' background and social environment;
- information from DNS _whois_ databases.
